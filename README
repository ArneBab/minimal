#+title: Minimalist appearance for Emacs

minimal.el adds a minor mode providing a minimalist appearance for
Emacs. Toggle the minor mode with =M-x minimal-mode=. By default, this
gets rid of

- mode line
- scroll bars
- menu bar
- tool bar

The mode line is replaced by a thin separator line. The following
variables are intended for user customizations:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar minimal-zap-mode-line t
  "Should the mode line be turned into a thin separator line?")

(defvar minimal-zap-scroll-bar t
  "Should the scroll bars be removed?")

(defvar minimal-zap-menu-bar t
  "Should the menu bar be removed?")

(defvar minimal-zap-tool-bar t
  "Should the tool bar be removed?")

(defvar minimal-mode-line-background "red"
  "Background colour for active mode line face when minimal minor
  mode is active")

(defvar minimal-mode-line-inactive-background "grey"
  "Background colour for inactive mode line face when minimal
  minor mode is active")

(defvar minimal-mode-line-height 0.1
  "Height of mode line when minimal minor mode is active")
#+end_src
