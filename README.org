[[file:davison-minimal-research-thumb.png]]

See the [[http://dandavison.github.com/minimal/][minimal.el webpage]] for screenshot and instructions.

minimal.el adds a minor mode providing a minimalist appearance for
Emacs. Toggle the minor mode with =M-x minimal-mode=. By default, this
gets rid of

- mode line
- scroll bars
- menu bar
- tool bar

The mode line is replaced by a thin separator line.
